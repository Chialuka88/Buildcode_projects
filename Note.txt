What is a function?
==> A function is nothing more than a wrapper for some code.
== A function groups statement together
==> A function makes your code reusable

The function call is typically the name of the function we want to call(aka invoke)
followed again by the parentheses. Without our function call, the function we created
doesn't do anything.It is the function call that wakes our function up and makes it do things.
